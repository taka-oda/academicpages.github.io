### - Open Bandit Project

*Open Bandit Dataset* is a public real-world logged bandit feedback data. The dataset is provided by ZOZO, Inc., the largest Japanese fashion e-commerce company. It is especially suitable for off-policy evaluation (OPE), which attempts to predict the performance of hypothetical policies using data generated by a different, past policy. The data contain the ground-truth about the performance of several bandit policies and enable the fair comparisons of different OPE estimators.

*Open Bandit Pipeline* is a series of implementations of dataset preprocessing, offline bandit simulation, and evaluation of OPE estimators. This pipeline allows researchers to focus on building their OPE estimator and easily compare it with othersâ€™ methods in realistic and reproducible ways. Thus, it facilitates reproducible research on bandit algorithms and off-policy evaluation. <br>
